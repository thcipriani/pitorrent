# pitorrent

## How to run this shabaz

    git clone https://github.com/thcipriani/pitorrent.git && cd pitorrent
    npm install
    ./bin/pitorrent [magnet link]

Hit ^C to stop

Simple as that.

## Caveat emptor

I built this in, like, an hour todayâ€”it's awful.

The good code is pretty much a complete rip off of
https://github.com/xat/torrentcast which looks like much better software.

I created this because I didn't want to run an express app on my pi.
